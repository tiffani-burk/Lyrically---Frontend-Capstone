# Lyrically 

### `Overview`

This is a single page web based application that allows the user to create a digital setlist. The user can create a song, by adding their lyrics into a form, which then rendors the song to their song library. They can view that song, which dynamically rendors the name, artist, key, timing and lyrics of the song. The user can also create or delete a setlist and store their choice of songs to that setlist. They have the option to add as many songs and setlists as they would like. 

### `Problem Solved`

This application solves a problem for musicians, which is that they can't store original songs (songs they wrote) and cover songs (songs other people wrote) in one place. Lyrically allows the user to store both covers and originals in one place.
